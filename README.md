# Calculator

Yet another project - creating online calculator with standard arithmetic operations.

Built with:
#HTML,
#CSS,
#Vanilla JS (focused mostly on the DOM manipulation)

What I've learned:

1. This calculator should NOT evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time, as it would require eval()to make that possible, which (without getting into much details) is bad practice and should be avoided when possible.

2. Proper variable/function naming is an important thing.

3. Golden rule - "less is more".
   Overcomplicating code is a bad habit and this project forced me to learn that the hard way.

4. toFixed() & toExponential() comes in handy when working with imprecise decimal numbers.
