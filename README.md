# Calculator

Yet another project from The Odin Project curriculum - creating Calculator with standard arithmetic operations, built with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS and focused mostly on the DOM manipulation.

This project requires refreshing my knowledge on everything I've learned so far about JavaScript and is probably even more complicated than Etch-a-Sketch, therefore I am going to update this description with information about any bigger problems I may bump into during my coding.

Since grid seems to be underrated when it comes to CSS functionalities, I've decided to use it for calculator.
I know... it shouldn't be something I brag about but at this time I don't really feel comfortable with it, so it is kind of a big deal for me :)
There were some issues with how grid should be constructed to make buttons exact same size, but after some "trial and error" method, it finally looks as intended.
Funny enough, now that I look at it - grid is so much easier and cleaner than flex when it comes to setting up more complicated layouts. I will definitely use it more often in my future projects.
